In describing the charge carriers' separation mechanism in the organic solar cell, providing a method, which considers
the impact of all parameters of interest on the same footing within an inexpensive numerical effort, could play an
essential role. We use here a simple tight-binding model to describe the dissociation of the charge carriers and
investigate their dependence on the physical parameters of the system. We demonstrate that the quantum yield of the
cell is subtly controlled by the collective action of the Coulomb interaction of the electron–hole pair, electron–phonon
coupling, and the geminate recombination of the charge carriers. This approach should help us understand the performance
of organic solar cells and optimize their efficiency.
