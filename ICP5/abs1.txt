We analyse the results of Libet type experiments in light of a quantum physics inspired model of consciousness states
and show that the claim about the absence of free will due to onset of readiness potentials prior to awareness of
decision is not tenable. It simply points to the fact of the existence of unceasing subconscious processing beneath the
conscious level out of which only those that receive the impetus to come up to conscious awareness by the focusing of
attention, only are known. The free will problem then shifts to the free will to direct attention on certain
subconscious processes. But the subconscious processes possess an autonomy of their own, which point to the operations
of a superconscious all-pervading will that is omniscient and hence governs all individual will.
