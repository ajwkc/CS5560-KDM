The term soul is used in the traditional literature as a synonym for one’s true Self and is associated with the
subjective essence of one’s living. Since, we don’t have any means to quantify it, the science has ruled out this idea
from its investigations. But, in a recent study, Ceylan et al. (2017) has reintroduced the word soul to scientific
literature and examined the possibility of the study of the soul through scientific modalities. The primary focus of
their study is to find and understand the scientific analog of the soul as quoted and discussed in the traditional
literature. In the present paper, we examine the idea of a soul that uses a novel approach; integrating neuroscience and
quantum physics, as proposed in Ceylan et al. (2017). For this purpose, we make use of findings from neuroscientific
studies on meditation to understand the concepts of soul and consciousness in terms of inhibition mechanisms. In this
context, this paper serves as an attempt to call for more studies to discuss and expand the hypothesis about the soul
as uninhibited mental activity.
